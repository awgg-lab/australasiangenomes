Biodiversity is declining globally, and Australia has one of the worst extinction records for mammals. The development of sequencing technologies means that genomic approaches are now available as important tools for wildlife conservation and management. Despite this, genome sequences are available for only 5% of threatened Australian species. Here we report the first reference genome for the woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi), a critically endangered marsupial from Western Australia, and the first genome within the Potoroidae family. The woylie reference genome was generated using Pacific Biosciences HiFi long-reads, resulting in a 3.39 Gbp assembly with a scaffold N50 of 6.49 Mbp and 86.5% complete mammalian BUSCOs. Assembly of a global transcriptome from pouch skin, tongue, heart and blood RNA-seq reads was used to guide annotation with Fgenesh++, resulting in the annotation of 24,655 genes. The woylie reference genome is a valuable resource for conservation, management and investigations into disease-induced decline of this critically endangered marsupial.
